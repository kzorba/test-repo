* bgp-te-tool: A tool to automate BGP Traffic Engineering in ISPs
** Description
A demonstration of a BGP TE tool in a lab topology using Juniper vMX routers.

The tool utilizes Netbox (IPAM to contain announcement prefixes) and peering-manager (for eBGP Internet peerings) as sources of truth. These systems contain our intended announcements, their policy and all the BGP peerings with the various peers.
